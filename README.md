eflag
=====
eflag is a rewrite of emod because of the lack of copyright for the
original project. 
eflag is designed to simplify the task of managing package files
and making the task less cumbersome.


Goals:
=========
* Adding, deleting, and modifying rules on the fly.
* Converting package files from directory to file structure and vice versa.
* Simplicity.

Thanks:
=======
Thanks to [Pyntony](http://github.com/Pyntony) for the original tool
[emod](http://github.com/Pyntony/emod).

*Note: eflag is still in development, don't use it directly on your package files
unless if you have a backup.
