eflag
=====
eflag is a rewrite of emod because of the lack of copyright in
original project. 
eflag is designed to simplify the task of managing package files
and making the task less cumbersome.


Goals:
=========
* Adding, deleting, and modifying rules on the fly.
* Converting package files from directory to file structure and vice versa.
* Simpliciy

Thanks:
=======
Thanks to [Pyntony](github.com/Pyntony) for the original tool
[emod](github.com/Pyntony/emod)

*Note: eflag is still in development, don't use directly on your package files
unless if you have a backup
